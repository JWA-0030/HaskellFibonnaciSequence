1.

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Using a list comprehension, find the sum of all numbers from 1 to n that are odd multiples of 3
and 7.

The eight divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24. The ten numbers not exceeding 100 having
exactly eight divisors are 24, 30, 40, 42, 54, 56, 66, 70, 78 and 88. Let f(n) be the count of numbers
not exceeding n with exactly eight divisors. You are given f(100) = 10 and f(1000) = 180. Find
f(104).
